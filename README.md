# Codecademy ML Projects
A repo holding the ML projects I did as a part of Codecademy courses.

Here are all of the projects contained in this repo
* Breast Cancer - KNN Classification (Guided)
* Find The Flag - Decision Trees (Guided)

Guided - Means that Codecademy gave me steps for the project
UnGuided - Means that I just got the dataset
